ImprovedBlizzardUI
==================

Improved Blizzard UI is an attempt to improve the default Blizzard interface. This has been customized to how I personally like my UI set up. There is some very basic configuration in game but things like positioning and scale of items still needs modifying directly in the LUA.

Only 1920x1080 is supported out of the box other resolutions will need tweaks.

Localized for enGB / enUS / ruRU.
